This project has two modules, the first one is in the Pre-processing folder and the second module is in the Machine Learning folder. The pre-processing folder includes an example image dataset named "testData" and a mask image named "mask1.png". The machine learning folder provides a pre-trained model "trained.mat" and test dataset named "test_out" for classification. 

To start the pre-processing module example, simply open and run testPic2.m, a folder called "testData_out" will be created and will contain the pre-processed images for machine learning module.

To start the Machine Learning module example, simply open and run justTesting.m, a text file called "counts.txt" will be generated and will contain the classification result for images in "test_out" folder. 

Please see accompanied manual for detailed description.
